Weeks 3-5: Linear models
Classical and modern approaches to modelling
Analysis of variance: ANOVA & ANCOVA
Week 6: Generalized linear models
Nonlinear regression
Rest of Semester

### Method of Evaluation:

Homework 30%.
Assigned weekly, on Fridays after class and is due the following Friday.
Homework should be turned in online in CourseWorks, before 5 PM each Friday.
Midterm/Test 30%.
Date: TBD
Project 40%.
Due Monday, December 9, 2024. The report should be sent via email to: da15@columbia.edu

### Project:  

Students will be asked to propose a data set, with the approval of the instructor, define a research problem, develop an analysis plan, and submit a report at the end of the semester.
Only original projects will be accepted
 Students expected to work in groups of about 5 students. Groups should be formed by September 20th, and the names of members listed on the first sheet at:

You must use your UNI to access the spreadsheet.

Each group will choose a date for the presentation and sign up in the 2nd sheet (sign-up sheet named: Date/Time)
Each group to sign up in only one time slot. If all slots are full, sign up in the Waitlist column
Use the link to sign up for presentation time:

During the presentation, each member of the group will be expected to participate and answer questions. The presenter will be selected at random from the group.
All students are expected to attend the presentations and participate in the discussions
